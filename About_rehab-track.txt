Aim of rehab-track:
To create a single system to track clients through a vocational and life
rehabilitation program.

Why rehab-track?
Other systems, while coming close, didn't have the full package of what is
needed to track clients, discipline, skills training, progress, assets, and
various other things, such as auto-generation of roll calls, and study groups.

What language?
rehab-track will be written in Python3.6, using MySQL as the database

Can I help?
Sure, get hacking! Or buy me coffee!
